dotfiles
========

The dotfiles for my OSX machine


Installation
------------

Assuming you already have `git` installed, run the following command:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/ExPHAT/dotfiles;cd dotfiles;./setup.sh;cd -;
```

That will create a folder called `dotfiles` containing the repository and install all of the components
